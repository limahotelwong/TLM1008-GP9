Modify ADD (Option 


Input a string from console containing the folder path for the ADDs and parcel files such that the program can read all the data in the txt files into its memory 
Parse all information about ADDs and parcels and use for this appropriate data types and structures such as classes, arrays, vectors, etc. (vectors are dynamic arrays with useful functions, see: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) 
Compute and display an optimal solution to schedule parcels to ADDs such that all parcels and ADDs reach their destination before their set deadline. 
4) Compute and display an optimal solution to schedule all parcels to ADDs such that the number of ADDs is minimized, i.e., you should try to fill up the ADDs to full capacity before assigning another ADD.
Display at least the following information:  Schedule by ADD  Schedule by parcel  Only ADDs that are not at full capacity  Parcels that are not assigned to any ADD 
Save the scheduling plan to a text file. The scheduling should clearly list out the ADDs assigned to each parcel 
Add/Edit/Delete functionality for both ADDs and parcels
